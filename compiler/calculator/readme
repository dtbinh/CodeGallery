A simple interactive calculator:
================================

cal - integers only [to make: make cal]
calx - real numbers, power (^) [make calx]

A simple calculator language (sc) - interpreter and compiler
============================================================

c5i - interpreter [make c5i]
c5c - compiler -> [make c5c]
as - the assembler for a simulated stack machine [make as]

Example programs:

for.sc - a double for loop
fact.sc - factorial

To run:

c5i fact.sc
c5c fact.sc >fact.as
as fact.as

c5i for.sc
c5c for.sc >for.as
as for.as
